## Project 1: EC2 Web Application Outage – Network & Security Troubleshooting

### Environment
- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux, t2.micro – Free Tier)
- Apache Web Server (httpd)
- Default VPC, Security Groups, Internet Gateway

### Problem
A web application hosted on an EC2 instance was not accessible via its public IP address, even though the instance was running.

### Symptoms
- Browser error: `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT` (This site can’t be reached)
- SSH access to the instance was successful
- EC2 status checks passed

### Investigation
- Verified EC2 instance state and health checks
- Confirmed Apache service was running using `systemctl status httpd`
- Reviewed Security Group inbound rules for HTTP (port 80)
- Verified VPC route table had an Internet Gateway route

### Root Cause
The HTTP (port 80) inbound rule was missing in the Security Group, blocking external web traffic while network routing and the application service were functioning correctly.

### Resolution
- Added HTTP (port 80) inbound rule to the Security Group
- Verified Apache service status
- Retested access using the public IP

### Outcome
Web application access was restored successfully.

### Key Learning
- Internet Gateway provides the network path; Security Groups control traffic permissions
- Missing Security Group rules can block application access even when instances and services are healthy
- Layer-by-layer troubleshooting helps identify the true root cause efficiently

## Skills Demonstrated
- AWS EC2
- VPC & Internet Gateway
- Security Groups
- Linux service troubleshooting
- Root cause analysis
